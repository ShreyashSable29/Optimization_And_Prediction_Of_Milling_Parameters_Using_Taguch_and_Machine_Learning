# Optimization_And_Prediction_Of_Milling_Parameters_Using_Taguch_and_Machine_Learning
This Repository contains the project in which the Optimization is done along with the Prediction using the Random Forest Regressor for the Milling Parameters.

The DataSet on which the work is done is collected Manually after performing the Milling Operation on some parameters which were provided by the Taguchi Software.
After some average value give the Tagichi software gives 27 different values on which we perform milling operation and collected the readings. After collection of the Data We perform Prediction of the values for checking weather the milling done on the parameters will give good surface finish or not.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this research is to optimize and predict the milling parameters using a combination of the Taguchi method and machine learning techniques.
The Taguchi method provides an efficient experimental design approach, while machine learning algorithms offer the ability to learn from data and make accurate predictions.
By integrating these two approaches, we aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of milling parameter optimization.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this study are as follows:
- To understand the principles and applications of the Taguchi method and machine learning in the context of milling parameter optimization.
- To develop a Taguchi experimental design for collecting data on milling parameters.
- To optimize the milling parameters using the Taguchi method.
- To develop a machine learning model for predicting optimal milling parameters.
- To integrate the Taguchi method and machine learning to achieve enhanced optimization and prediction results.
- To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it with traditional optimization methods.

## Scope
This study focuses on the optimization and prediction of milling parameters using the Taguchi method and machine learning techniques. The research will be conducted using a specific milling process and dataset. The performance of the proposed approach will be evaluated based on selected performance metrics. However, the implementation and generalizability to other manufacturing processes may vary.
