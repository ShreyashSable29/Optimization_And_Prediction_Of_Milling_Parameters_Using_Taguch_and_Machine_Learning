# Optimization_And_Prediction_Of_Milling_Parameters_Using_Taguch_and_Machine_Learning
This Repository contains the project in which the Optimization is done along with the Prediction using the Random Forest Regressor for the Milling Parameters.

The DataSet on which the work is done is collected Manually after performing the Milling Operation on some parameters which were provided by the Taguchi Software.
After some average value give the Tagichi software gives 27 different values on which we perform milling operation and collected the readings. After collection of the Data We perform Prediction of the values for checking weather the milling done on the parameters will give good surface finish or not.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this research is to optimize and predict the milling parameters using a combination of the Taguchi method and machine learning techniques.
The Taguchi method provides an efficient experimental design approach, while machine learning algorithms offer the ability to learn from data and make accurate predictions.
By integrating these two approaches, we aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of milling parameter optimization.
